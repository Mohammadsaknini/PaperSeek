    "    \"Software Defect Prediction\": \"\"\"Title: A Systematic Literature Review of Software Defect Prediction: Research Trends, Datasets, Methods and Frameworks[SEP]\n",
    "    Abstract: Recent studies of software defect prediction typically produce datasets, methods and frameworks which allow software engineers to focus on development activities in terms of defect-prone code, thereby improving software quality and making better use of resources. Many software defect prediction datasets, methods and frameworks are published disparate and complex, thus a comprehensive picture of the current state of defect prediction research that exists is missing. This literature review aims to identify and analyze the research trends, datasets, methods and frameworks used in software defect prediction research betweeen 2000 and 2013. Based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 71 software defect prediction studies published between January 2000 and December 2013 were remained and selected to be investigated further. This literature review has been undertaken as a systematic literature review. Systematic literature review is defined as a process of identifying, assessing, and interpreting all available research evidence with the purpose to provide answers for specific research questions. Analysis of the selected primary studies revealed that current software defect prediction research focuses on five topics and trends: estimation, association, classification, clustering and dataset analysis. The total distribution of defect prediction methods is as follows. 77.46% of the research studies are related to classification methods, 14.08% of the studies focused on estimation methods, and 1.41% of the studies concerned on clustering and association methods. In addition, 64.79% of the research studies used public datasets and 35.21% of the research studies used private datasets. Nineteen different methods have been applied to predict software defects. From the nineteen methods, seven most applied methods in software defect prediction are identified. Researchers proposed some techniques for improving the accuracy of machine learning classifier for software defect prediction by ensembling some machine learning methods, by using boosting algorithm, by adding feature selection and by using parameter optimization for some classifiers. The results of this research also identified three frameworks that are highly cited and therefore influential in the software defect prediction field. They are Menzies et al. Framework, Lessmann et al. Framework, and Song et al. Framework.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"Software Fault Prediction Metrics\": \"\"\"Title: Software fault prediction metrics: A systematic literature review[SEP]\n",
    "    Abstract: ContextSoftware metrics may be used in fault prediction models to improve software quality by predicting fault location.ObjectiveThis paper aims to identify software metrics and to assess their applicability in software fault prediction. We investigated the influence of context on metrics’ selection and performance.MethodThis systematic literature review includes 106 papers published between 1991 and 2011. The selected papers are classified according to metrics and context properties.ResultsObject-oriented metrics (49%) were used nearly twice as often compared to traditional source code metrics (27%) or process metrics (24%). Chidamber and Kemerer’s (CK) object-oriented metrics were most frequently used. According to the selected studies there are significant differences between the metrics used in fault prediction performance. Object-oriented and process metrics have been reported to be more successful in finding faults compared to traditional size and complexity metrics. Process metrics seem to be better at predicting post-release faults compared to any static code metrics.ConclusionMore studies should be performed on large industrial software systems to find metrics more relevant for the industry and to answer the question as to which metrics should be used in a given context.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"Cloud Migration\": \"\"\"Title: Cloud Migration Research: A Systematic Review[SEP]\n",
    "    Abstract: Background--By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective--This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method--We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results--The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion--This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"Multicore Performance Prediction\": \"\"\"Title: Parallelization, Modeling, and Performance Prediction in the Multi-/Many Core Area: A Systematic Literature Review[SEP]\n",
    "    Abstract: Context: Software developers face complex, connected, and large software projects. The development of such systems involves design decisions that directly impact the quality of the software. For an early decision making, software developers can use model-based prediction approaches for (non-)functional quality properties. Unfortunately, the accuracy of these approaches is challenged by newly introduced hardware features like multiple cores within a single CPU (multicores) and their dependence on shared memory and other shared resources. Objectives: Our goal is to understand whether and how existing model-based performance prediction approaches face this challenge. We plan to use gained insights as foundation for enriching existing prediction approaches with capabilities to predict systems running on multicores. Methods: We perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify current model-based prediction approaches in the context of multicores. Results: Our SLR covers the software engineering, embedded systems, High Performance Computing, and Software Performance Engineering domains for which we examined 34 sources in detail. We found various performance prediction approaches which tries to increase prediction accuracy for multicore systems by including shared memory designs to the prediction models. Conclusion: However, our results show that the memory designs models are only in an initial phase. Further research has to be done to improve cache, memory, and memory bandwidth model as well as to include auto tuner support.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"Business Process Meta Models\": \"\"\"Title: What is a process model composed of?[SEP]\n",
    "    Abstract:  Business process modelling languages typically enable the representation of business process models by employing (graphical) symbols. These symbols can vary depending upon the verbosity of the language, the modelling paradigm, the focus of the language and so on. To make explicit different constructs and rules employed by a specific language, as well as bridge the gap across different languages, meta-models have been proposed in the literature. These meta-models are a crucial source of knowledge on what state-of-the-art literature considers relevant to describe business processes. The goal of this work is to provide the first extensive systematic literature review (SLR) of business process meta-models. This SLR aims to answer research questions concerning: (1) the kind of meta-models proposed in the literature, (2) the recurring constructs they contain, (3) their purposes and (4) their evaluations. The SRL was performed manually considering papers automatically retrieved from reference paper repositories as well as proceedings of the main conferences in the Business Process Management research area. Sixty-five papers were selected and evaluated against four research questions. The results indicate the existence of a reasonable body of work conducted in this specific area, but not a full maturity. In particular, in answering the research questions several challenges have (re-)emerged for the Business Process Community, concerning: (1) the type of elements that constitute a Business Process and their meaning, (2) the absence of a (or several) reference meta-model(s) for the community, (3) the purpose for which meta-models are introduced in the literature and (4) a framework for the evaluation of the meta-models themselves. Moreover, the classification framework devised to answer the four research questions can provide a reference structure for future descriptive categorizations.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"Data Stream Processing Latency\": \"\"\"Title: Enactment of adaptation in data stream processing with latency implications—A systematic literature review[SEP]\n",
    "    Abstract: Context Stream processing is a popular paradigm to continuously process huge amounts of data. Runtime adaptation plays a significant role in supporting the optimization of data processing tasks. In recent years runtime adaptation has received significant interest in scientific literature. However, so far no categorization of the enactment approaches for runtime adaptation in stream processing has been established. Objective This paper identifies and characterizes different approaches towards the enactment of runtime adaptation in stream processing with a main focus on latency as quality dimension. Method We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) targeting five main research questions. An automated search, resulting in 244 papers, was conducted. 75 papers published between 2006 and 2018 were finally included. From the selected papers, we extracted data like processing problems, adaptation goals, enactment approaches of adaptation, enactment techniques, evaluation metrics as well as evaluation parameters used to trigger the enactment of adaptation in their evaluation. Results We identified 17 different enactment approaches and categorized them into a taxonomy. For each, we extracted the underlying technique used to implement this enactment approach. Further, we identified 9 categories of processing problems, 6 adaptation goals, 9 evaluation metrics and 12 evaluation parameters according to the extracted data properties. Conclusion We observed that the research interest on enactment approaches to the adaptation of stream processing has significantly increased in recent years. The most commonly applied enactment approaches are parameter adaptation to tune parameters or settings of the processing, load balancing used to re-distribute workloads, and processing scaling to dynamically scale up and down the processing. In addition to latency, most adaptations also address resource fluctuation / bottleneck problems. For presenting a dynamic environment to evaluate enactment approaches, researchers often change input rates or processing workloads.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"Software Process Line\": \"\"\"Title: Software process line as an approach to support software process reuse: A systematic literature review[SEP]\n",
    "    Abstract: Context Software Process Line (SPrL) aims at providing a systematic reuse technique to support reuse experiences and knowledge in the definition of software processes for new projects thus contributing to reduce effort and costs and to achieve improvements in quality. Although the research body in SPrL is expanding, it is still an immature area with results offering an overall view scattered with no consensus. Objective The goal of this work is to identify existing approaches for developing, using, managing and visualizing the evolution of SPrLs and to characterize their support, especially during the development of reusable process family artefacts, including an overview of existing SPrL supporting tools in their multiple stages; to analyse variability management and component-based aspects in SPrL; and, finally, to list practical examples and conducted evaluations. This research aims at reaching a broader and more consistent view of the research area and to provide perspectives and gaps for future research. Method We performed a systematic literature review according to well-established guidelines set. We used tools to partially support the process, which relies on a six-member research team. Results We report on 49 primary studies that deal mostly with conceptual or theoretical proposals and the domain engineering stage. Years 2014, 2015, and 2018 yielded the largest number of articles. This can indicate SPrL as a recent research theme and one that attracts ever-increasing interest. Conclusion Although this research area is growing, there is still a lack of practical experiences and approaches for actual applications or project-specific process derivations and decision-making support. The concept of an integrated reuse infrastructure is less discussed and explored; and the development of integrated tools to support all reuse stages is not fully addressed. Other topics for future research are discussed throughout the paper with gaps pointed as opportunities for improvements in the area.\"\"\",\n",
